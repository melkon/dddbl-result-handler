Additional Result Handler for DDDBL to make it compatible with the PHP-version

IMPORTANT NOTE:
RDBI will change the way Result Driver are implemented in the next release. 
The Result Handler are written against the master-branch, so will work with the next release
BUT NOT with the current 0.9.1

If you're using bundler, it will be instructed to install the git-master branch of RDBI.
